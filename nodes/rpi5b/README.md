## üß≠ Overview
**rpi5b** acts as the **entry point for all external traffic**.  
It manages secure tunneling, routing, and reverse proxying for TerminSuite‚Äôs exposed services.

---

## üìö Service Overview

| Service | Description | Docker Mode | Notes |
|----------|--------------|--------------|-------|
| **[Cloudflared](../../services/cloudflared)** | Secure Cloudflare Tunnel for inbound/outbound access | Normal | Avoids port exposure to the Internet |
| **[Traefik](../../services/traefik)** | Reverse proxy and router for HTTP/HTTPS services | Rootless | Handles routing, TLS, and headers |
| **[Connector](../../services/connector)** | Internal connector for local network bridges | Rootless | Handles internal service discovery |
| **Falco** | Security monitoring and anomaly detection | Normal | Monitors system and containers |

---

## üîß Integration & Network Role
This node is the **main gateway** between Cloudflare and the internal TerminSuite environment.  
All requests pass through the Cloudflare tunnel and are routed by Traefik to the appropriate backend service.  
It communicates directly with **rpi5a (DNS)** and **rpi5c (SSO)**.

---

## üîê Falco Integration
Falco tracks abnormal network activity, unexpected port bindings, or container restarts.  
Events are forwarded to **rpi5e** for correlation.

---

## üöÄ Performance & Resources
- **Memory:** 4GB RAM (recommended for concurrency under heavy load)  
- **CPU:** Medium under parallel streaming or uploads  
- **Docker:** Mixed ‚Äî Traefik and Connector run in Rootless mode; Cloudflared and Falco require Normal mode.
