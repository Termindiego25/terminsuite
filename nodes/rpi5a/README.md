## üìö Service Overview

| Service | Description | Docker Mode | Notes |
|----------|--------------|--------------|-------|
| **[Pi-hole](../../services/pihole)** | DNS filtering and blocking for ads, trackers, and malicious domains | Normal | Requires privileged ports |
| **[Unbound](../../services/unbound)** | Validating recursive DNS resolver | Normal | Works as Pi-hole upstream resolver |
| **Falco** | Runtime security and anomaly detection | Normal | Monitors all host-level events |

---

## üîß Integration & Network Role
This node provides filtered DNS resolution for all TerminSuite components.  
It acts as the **primary resolver** for both internal services and user devices through Pi-hole and Unbound.  
Logs and Falco alerts are sent to **rpi5e** for analysis.

---

## üîê Falco Integration
Falco monitors direct system access, configuration changes, and privilege escalations.  
All alerts are securely forwarded via syslog (TLS) to **rpi5e**.

---

## üöÄ Performance & Resources
- **Memory:** 2GB RAM (typical usage < 1.2GB)  
- **CPU:** Very low  
- **Docker:** All containers run in normal mode due to network privilege requirements.
