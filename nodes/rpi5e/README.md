## üß≠ Overview
**rpi5e** is the **central analysis node** for TerminSuite.  
It aggregates logs, correlates events, and performs intrusion detection across the entire network.

---

## üìö Service Overview

| Service | Description | Docker Mode | Notes |
|----------|--------------|--------------|-------|
| **IDS/NIDS/IDP Stack (e.g. Suricata, Zeek, Wazuh)** | Advanced network and host intrusion detection | Rootless | Analyses and classifies traffic |
| **Logstash** | Central log collector and processor | Rootless | Integrates Falco and Cynet inputs |
| **Falco** | Local node security monitoring | Normal | Protects node integrity |

---

## üîß Integration & Network Role
Receives logs and Falco alerts from all nodes (a‚Äìf).  
Acts as the **correlation hub** for the TerminSuite monitoring architecture.  
Provides data to visualization or alerting systems (future Grafana/ELK stack).

---

## üîê Falco Integration
Local Falco instance monitors the analysis stack itself.  
Falco data from all other nodes is received and processed by **Logstash**, avoiding redundant Falco server layers.

---

## üöÄ Performance & Resources
- **Memory:** 16GB RAM (required for parallel IDS + log processing)  
- **CPU:** High under correlation and alert enrichment  
- **Docker:** Rootless (IDS, Logstash) + Normal (Falco)
