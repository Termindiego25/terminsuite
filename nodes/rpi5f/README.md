## üß≠ Overview
**rpi5f** operates as a **dedicated network tap**, capturing traffic from a mirrored router port.  
It sends network telemetry and wireless metrics to the analysis node.

---

## üìö Service Overview

| Service | Description | Docker Mode | Notes |
|----------|--------------|--------------|-------|
| **Nzyme Tap** | Passive network, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth collector | Rootless | Sends captured data to Nzyme server |
| **Falco** | Local runtime security and process monitor | Normal | Protects against local tampering |

---

## üîß Integration & Network Role
This node connects to a mirrored port on the router, feeding captured data into the **IDS/Logstash pipeline (rpi5e)**.  
It remains **isolated** to prevent interference or feedback loops.

---

## üîê Falco Integration
Falco supervises the Nzyme process and ensures that capture operations remain stable.  
Its telemetry does **not duplicate** Nzyme data ‚Äî Falco audits the system, not the network.

---

## üöÄ Performance & Resources
- **Memory:** 2GB RAM (ample for capture workloads)  
- **CPU:** Very low  
- **Docker:** Rootless (Nzyme Tap) + Normal (Falco)
