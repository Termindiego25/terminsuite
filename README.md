# TerminSuite: Raspberry Pi Network with Open-Source Applications

**TerminSuite** is a modular infrastructure built on **Raspberry Pi 5** devices and **Docker containers**, designed to host and secure a suite of open-source services.
It provides centralized authentication, DNS filtering, secure remote access, and self-hosted media capabilities ‚Äî optimized for **home labs**, **educational environments**, or **small-scale networks**.

## 1. Introduction

**TerminSuite** provides a secure and efficient environment for managing open-source applications through a distributed network of Raspberry Pi devices.
The setup is containerized using **Docker**, ensuring modularity, easy updates, and resource isolation.

The core services currently implemented include:

* **DNS filtering and privacy protection (Pi-hole + Unbound)**
* **Reverse proxy and TLS termination (Traefik)**
* **Secure tunnel access (Cloudflared)**
* **Centralized authentication (OpenLDAP + Keycloak)**
* **Password management (Passbolt)**
* **Self-hosted media service (Emby)**

Each Raspberry Pi serves a specific purpose, and all communicate internally through a private Docker network managed by **Traefik**.

## 2. Device Infrastructure

### üß† **[RPi5A](https://github.com/Termindiego25/terminsuite/tree/main/nodes/rpi5a) ‚Äî DNS and Network Filtering**

* **[Pi-hole](https://github.com/Termindiego25/terminsuite/tree/main/services/pihole)**: Local DNS resolver and ad-blocker, filtering unwanted domains and providing privacy across the network.
* **[Unbound](https://github.com/Termindiego25/terminsuite/tree/main/services/unbound)**: Recursive DNS resolver working alongside Pi-hole to ensure encrypted, independent DNS resolution.

---

### üåê **[RPi5B](https://github.com/Termindiego25/terminsuite/tree/main/nodes/rpi5b) ‚Äî Secure Entry and Routing**

* **[Cloudflared](https://github.com/Termindiego25/terminsuite/tree/main/services/cloudflared)**: Provides encrypted tunnels to expose internal services securely through Cloudflare without port forwarding.
* **[Connector](https://github.com/Termindiego25/terminsuite/tree/main/services/connector)**: Manages Cloudflared tunnel configurations and connections.
* **[Traefik](https://github.com/Termindiego25/terminsuite/tree/main/services/traefik)**: Acts as the reverse proxy, handling SSL termination and routing traffic to internal containers.

---

### üîê **[RPi5C](./nodes/rpi5c) ‚Äî Identity and Access Management**

* **[OpenLDAP](./services/openldap)**: Directory service for managing users, groups, and authentication records.
* **[Keycloak](./services/keycloak)**: Centralized SSO platform integrating with OpenLDAP for unified access management.
* **[Passbolt](./services/passbolt)**: Self-hosted password manager for secure credential storage and sharing.

---

### üé¨ **[RPi5D](https://github.com/Termindiego25/terminsuite/tree/main/nodes/rpi5d) ‚Äî Media Server**

* **[Emby](https://github.com/Termindiego25/terminsuite/tree/main/services/emby)**: DLNA-compatible media server for internal streaming and library management.

---

## 3. Device Interconnection

* **Router**:

  * Acts as the main gateway and firewall.
  * Handles all outbound/inbound traffic and routes DNS queries to the Pi-hole instance.

* **Internal Docker Network**:

  * Enables isolated communication between containers on the same Raspberry Pi or across devices.
  * **No direct exposure** ‚Äî all external access is handled via **Cloudflared** ‚Üí **Traefik** ‚Üí **Application**.

---

## 4. Connection Flow

1. **External Access**

   * Users connect through **Cloudflared**, establishing a secure tunnel managed by Cloudflare.

2. **Traffic Routing**

   * **Traefik** receives incoming requests, validates routing rules, and forwards them to the correct container.

3. **DNS Resolution**

   * **Pi-hole** handles DNS requests, filtering ads and trackers.
   * **Unbound** recursively resolves domains, ensuring privacy and independence from third-party DNS servers.

4. **Authentication**

   * **Keycloak** manages logins and integrates with **OpenLDAP** for user validation.

5. **Service Access**

   * Once authenticated, users can access services such as **Passbolt** (for password management) or **Emby** (for internal media streaming).

---

## 5. Authentication and Application Access

* **SSO (Single Sign-On)** via **Keycloak**, referencing **OpenLDAP** as the identity provider.
* **Role-based Access Control (RBAC)** managed through Keycloak groups.
* **Passbolt** provides encrypted password sharing among authenticated users.
* **All user data and credentials remain within the internal network**, never exposed externally.

---

## 6. Security Overview

TerminSuite‚Äôs security model is based on **defense-in-depth** and the **principle of least privilege**:

* **Cloudflared** eliminates the need for open ports, reducing the external attack surface.
* **Traefik** automatically manages TLS certificates and reverse proxy routing through Cloudflare tunnels.
* **Pi-hole + Unbound** enforce local DNS privacy and prevent exposure to public resolvers.
* **OpenLDAP + Keycloak** centralize authentication and user control.

---

## 7. Security Enhancements and Best Practices

* **Docker Rootless Mode**: Minimizes privilege escalation risks.
  ‚Üí [Rootless Docker Guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/)
* **Docker Secrets**: Protects sensitive credentials (LDAP binds, API keys, SSO secrets).
  ‚Üí [Docker Secrets Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/secrets/)
* **TLS Certificates via Cloudflare**: All traffic is encrypted end-to-end using Cloudflare-managed certificates.
* **Automated Backups**: LDAP and Passbolt databases are periodically backed up for disaster recovery.
