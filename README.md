## 1. Introduction

**TerminSuite** provides a secure and efficient environment for managing open-source applications through a distributed network of **Raspberry Pi 5** devices.  
The setup is containerized using **Docker**, ensuring modularity, easy updates, and resource isolation.

The core services currently implemented include:

* **DNS filtering and privacy protection (Pi-hole + Unbound)**
* **Reverse proxy and TLS termination (Traefik)**
* **Secure tunnel access (Cloudflared + Connector)**
* **Centralized authentication (OpenLDAP + Keycloak)**
* **Password management (Passbolt)**
* **Self-hosted media service (Emby)**

Each Raspberry Pi serves a specific purpose and communicates internally through a private Docker network managed by **Traefik**.

## 2. Device Infrastructure

### üß† [**RPi5A ‚Äî DNS and Network Filtering (4 GB)**](./nodes/rpi5a)

This node handles DNS resolution, ad-blocking, and privacy enforcement across the internal network.

* **[Pi-hole](./services/pihole)** ‚Äî Local DNS resolver and network-wide ad-blocker, filtering unwanted domains and telemetry.  
* **[Unbound](./services/unbound)** ‚Äî Recursive DNS resolver that ensures encrypted, independent lookups without relying on external providers.

---

### üåê [**RPi5B ‚Äî Secure Entry and Routing (4 GB)**](./nodes/rpi5b)

This device manages secure ingress to the TerminSuite network via Cloudflare tunnels and routes traffic internally.

* **[Cloudflared](./services/cloudflared)** ‚Äî Establishes encrypted tunnels for secure external access without port forwarding.  
* **[Connector](./services/connector)** ‚Äî Simplifies Cloudflared configuration management and tunnel maintenance.  
* **[Traefik](./services/traefik)** ‚Äî Reverse proxy that handles SSL termination and routes requests to internal containers.

---

### üîê [**RPi5C ‚Äî Identity and Access Management (4 GB)**](./nodes/rpi5c)

This node manages user authentication, directory services, and credential storage for the entire suite.

* **[OpenLDAP](./services/openldap)** ‚Äî Centralized directory for user and group management.  
* **[Keycloak](./services/keycloak)** ‚Äî Unified Single Sign-On (SSO) platform integrated with OpenLDAP for identity validation.  
* **[Passbolt](./services/passbolt)** ‚Äî Self-hosted password manager enabling secure storage and sharing of credentials.

---

### üé¨ [**RPi5D ‚Äî Media Server (8 GB)**](./nodes/rpi5d)

This node is responsible for hosting multimedia services within the internal network.

* **[Emby](./services/emby)** ‚Äî DLNA-compatible media server for private streaming, transcoding, and library organization.

---

## 3. Device Interconnection

* **Router**  
  Acts as the main gateway and firewall, routing DNS queries to **Pi-hole** and managing inbound/outbound traffic.

* **Internal Docker Network**  
  Enables isolated communication between containers across devices.  
  No service is directly exposed ‚Äî all external access passes through:  
  **Cloudflared ‚Üí Traefik ‚Üí Application**

---

## 4. Connection Flow

1. **External Access** ‚Äî Users connect via **Cloudflared**, establishing a secure tunnel managed by Cloudflare.  
2. **Traffic Routing** ‚Äî **Traefik** receives incoming requests, applies routing rules, and forwards them to the target container.  
3. **DNS Resolution** ‚Äî **Pi-hole** filters unwanted domains, and **Unbound** performs recursive lookups.  
4. **Authentication** ‚Äî **Keycloak** manages logins and validates identities against **OpenLDAP**.  
5. **Service Access** ‚Äî Authenticated users can securely access services such as **Passbolt** or **Emby**.

---

## 5. Authentication and Application Access

* **Single Sign-On (SSO)** via **Keycloak**, using **OpenLDAP** as the identity source.  
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** implemented through Keycloak groups.  
* **Passbolt** enables encrypted credential sharing among authenticated users.  
* All sensitive data remains confined within the internal network.

---

## 6. Security Overview

TerminSuite applies **defense-in-depth** and the **principle of least privilege** across all layers:

* **Cloudflared** eliminates the need for open ports, minimizing external attack surfaces.  
* **Traefik** provides SSL termination and routing exclusively through Cloudflare tunnels.  
* **Pi-hole + Unbound** enforce DNS privacy and block malicious domains.  
* **OpenLDAP + Keycloak** centralize authentication and authorization.  
* **Passbolt** secures credential storage and sharing via strong cryptography.

---

## 7. Security Enhancements and Best Practices

* **Rootless Docker Mode** ‚Äî Reduces privilege escalation risks.  
  ‚Üí [Rootless Docker Guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/)  
* **Docker Secrets** ‚Äî Protects credentials such as LDAP binds and API keys.  
  ‚Üí [Docker Secrets Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/secrets/)  
* **TLS Certificates via Cloudflare** ‚Äî Ensures end-to-end encryption and automatic renewal.  
* **Automated Backups** ‚Äî LDAP and Passbolt databases are periodically backed up for disaster recovery.
